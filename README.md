Repository for the `Social Risk Appraisal` model by O'Gara, Kasman, HÃ©bert-Dufresne, and Hammond.

This repository contains several sub-directories:

1. model: the Netlogo model to generate the results
2. analysis: analytical scripts (in `R`) to make the figures
3. data: data from the experiments (note that larger data files are zipped).

Make sure to create a `figures` directory to save any figures.
